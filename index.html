												<h2>Love League of Legends</h2>
											</header>
											<p>League of Legends has been my favorite for some time. My favorite role in League of Legends is being the jungler. The reason I like being the Jungler in each game is because other roles restrict a lot of what I want to do. I feel free being jungler, in the game I can do anything I want, favorite thing to do is to make the other team's jungler lose his nerve by taking his camps which gives him gold which later on gets him items. I play on NA Server, and my gamer tag is BlancklFracture.</p>

												<h2>Love Anime</h2>

											<p>I love anime a lot, it helps me stay awake when im not playing video games. My favorite kind of anime is adventure, action packed, with a tad bit of humor in it. My favorite animes would be FairyTail and World Trigger.</p>

														<h3>TEAM SOLO MID</h3>
														<p>My Favorite LCS LOLEsports Team</p>
													</header>
													<p><font color="black">Team Solo Mid or for short TSM has been my favorite team since I started League of Legends. I have no idea why, but their mindset draws me in. TSM to me is always this very funny team that has amazing teamwork, through losses and wins im supporting them forever. Bjergsen and Doublelift are the two players I really admire, both of them are charasmatic, both are really good at their roles, both of them are calm and collective when in teamfights. I believe that one day TSM wuold win the World Championships. I know a lot of people would disagree with me since TSM is an NA team, and NA teams are usually not the best Teams in the League of Legends scene. But as a player coming from the NA Server, wouldn't it be incredible to wipe the smiles of all faces of the haters. Wouldn't it be nice to watch a team from NA beat the Koreans, the Chinese and the EU teams?</font></p>

														<h3>How I got into gaming?</h3>
														<p>CSGO-Smite-Minecraft-TeamFortress 2-Warframe-League of Legends</p>
													</header>
													<p><font color="black">So......when i was a little kid I loved minecraft, I would spend hours playing Super Smash Mobs on Minecraft. For some reason I found it very interesting. It was a different style of combat in Minecraft. And then I moved on to Team Fortress 2, again I would spend hours on it. It was really fun, an interesting style of an FPS game. After that I moved to smite, but this time I didnt spend hours on it, I simply played it because it piqued my interest. I then moved on to my 2nd favorite game which is WARFRAME, i would spend on average 70+ more hours on it a week, and that is a lot of time. I would spend money on it cuz why not, I loved the game. I played it for two straight years every week more that 70+ hours. Then League of Legends came along and WARFRAME became my side game. League of Legends was very different from any of the I played, it was really a game that I got to interact with other players and it is STILL very fun. CSGO soon later also became my side game, it is a game to relieve stress after I tilt in League.</font></p>

										<strong>CAIS is the first school I actually felt happy to be in. To be honest, I'm not a very good student in some classes. I would sometimes fall asleep in math and chinese. I wouldn't bother to listen to the teacher during science. It's just subjects that I don't find joy in learning. But I love art a lot, I also enjoy playing music instruments. English is also something that I like a lot, I get to read, write and it's just really fun.</strong>
